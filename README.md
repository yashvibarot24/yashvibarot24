### ⚡ **Fun Fact**
I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, but beyond numbers, I’m also driven by a desire to make a positive impact. During my time as a volunteer with **No One Sleeps Hungry** in Mumbai (India), I had the privilege of leading a team of 25+ volunteers to provide food and clothing to over 10,000 people. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, compassion, and using my skills to serve others. It continues to inspire me as I pursue a career in data analytics and business strategy—where I hope to drive impactful decisions and make a difference on a larger scale.
